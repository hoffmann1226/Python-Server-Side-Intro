## Today I am learning about using Python on the server side of an application.

Useful link for Flask (needed framework):
https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.

Features:
Development server and debugger
Integrated support for unit testing
RESTful request dispatching
Uses Jinja templating
Support for secure cookies (client side sessions)
100% WSGI 1.0 compliant
Unicode-based
Extensive documentation
Google App Engine compatibility
Extensions available to enhance features desired

Here is a good tutorial on building a RESTful API using Flask and Python:

This is an even better one:
